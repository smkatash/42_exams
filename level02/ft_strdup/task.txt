--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reproduce the behavior of the function strdup (man strdup).

Your function must be declared as follows:

char    *ft_strdup(char *src);

DESCRIPTION
     The strdup() function allocates sufficient memory for a 
     copy of the string s1, does the copy, and returns a pointer 
     to it.  The pointer may subse-
     quently be used as an argument to the function free(3).

     If insufficient memory is available, NULL is returned and 
     errno is set to ENOMEM.

     The strndup() function copies at most n characters from 
     the string s1 always NUL terminating the copied string.
